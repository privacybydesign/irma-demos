        <p>
            This demo is not a real video-streaming service but it does demonstrate several aspects of IRMA. 
            When you become IRMATube “premium member” you receive a membership card in your IRMA app with your 
            name on it. Subsequently, you can use the data on this card to watch 
            <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/demo-en/irmaTube/">(trailers of) movies</a> on the IRMATube main page. 
            As a premium member you also have access to the premium contents when clicking the "Show premium contents" button.
        </p>

        A few remarks:
        <ul>
        <li> No information about email addresses is retained or collected
        via this webpage. The revealed email addresses are only used for the
        purpose of this demo and disappear at the moment that the demo is
        closed.

        <li> In oder to become a premium member you need to disclose your name. 
            Under the hood several chained IRMA sesssions are used. In the first sesssion 
            your name gets disclosed which will be used without further user interaction 
            in the second session. The second session will issue the premium membership card.
        </ul>
        </p>
