            <h2>Digital signatures examples with IRMA</h2>
            <p>
		      On this page you can try out some examples in
		      which you can produce digital signatures
		      yourself, with the personal data in your IRMA
		      app. After pressing the buttons below, a signing
		      request appears in your IRMA app. When you read
		      this page on your phone, the switch to the IRMA
		      app is made automatically. When you read this
		      page on another device, you should first scan
		      the the QR code that appears, using the IRMA app
		      on your phone.
            </p>
            <p>
		      None of these example leads to actual
		      obligations. You can safely perform these
		      signing acts. The example text that you sign
		      does not commit you and the resulting signature
		      is not stored.
            </p>
            <p>
		      In order to be able to try out these examples
		      you must have collected the relevant personal
		      data in your IRMA app. This can be done via the
		      IRMA <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/">issuance
		      page</a>.

                    <button id="btn_email_consent" class="btn btn-primary">Consent to receiving advertisements via email</button>

                  <p id="email_consent_result_status"></p>
                  <p>
                    Here you are asked to give GDPR-style consent so
                    that advertisements can be sent to you. The
                    personal data with which you sign this consent
                    message is the email address at which you agree to
                    receive the advertisements. No further data of
                    yours are disclosed via this signature. In
                    principle, more of your personal data could be
                    included (like your gender, date of birth, etc) so
                    that advertisements are more targeted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Giving permission via a digital signature is the
                    perfect way to register consent under the General
                    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This consent in
                    the form of a digital signature can be transferred
                    to other (partner)companies, giving them
                    certainty, because they can check the signature
                    themselves. Also, these signatures can be shown to
                    the GDPR-regulator, upon request, in order to
                    demonstrate that consent has actually been given
                    by the owner of the email address.

                    Now you are asked to sign that you will contribute
                    financially to the foundation (not really). You
                    sign with your family name and with your mobile
                    phone number.

                    Here you are asked to sign as teacher that a
                    certain student has passed your exam. You sign
                    with three personal data items from SURFconext,
                    viz. your name, the (educational) institution
                    where you work, and your email address at that
                    institution.

            <p>
		      Attribute-based digital signatures offer many
		      new possibilities: a police officer, for
		      instance, can sign a report with his/her name
		      and police-registration number; in this way the
		      integrity and authenticity of this report is
		      guaranteed in the whole criminal justice
		      chain. Also, a medical doctor can sign a medical
		      statement with his/her own medical credentials,
		      so that everyone can verify that this statement
		      is actually signed by a medical doctor (and also
		      by whom). Within organisations all kinds of
		      decisions can be registered reliably and
		      verifiably with digital signatures. IRMA is the
		      only identity platform that seamlessly combines
		      both authentication and signing.
