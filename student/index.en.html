<h1>Demo: student verification with IRMA</h1>

<div id="result_status"></div>

<p>
This page contains an example of using IRMA for verifying whether
someone is a student or not. Additionally, the page explains how this
works and how this can be used for instance by webshops that wish to
give special offers to students. The first button below can be used to
check if a visitor actually is a student. The special point of IRMA is
its privacy-friendliness: the visitor discloses no other information
than the mere fact that (s)he is a student. This "student" property
exists as a special IRMA attribute; only the yes/no information in
this attribute is revealed to the requesting webpage.
</p>

<p>
Via the second button it is possible to request additional
information, namely the role of the visitor (student or employee) and
the name of the university (or educational institute) with which the
student/employee is associated. In this way exclusive access can be
organised for students and/or employees of a particular institute.
</p>


<p>
In order to be able to try out yourself the buttons below one needs to
have the IRMA
app <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/download-en/">installed</a>
with at least the <b>student</b> attribute loaded.  This can be done
via <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/surfnet?action=login">SURFconext
issuance webpage</a> of the Privacy by Design foundation. A succesful
check that the visitor is a student gives access to special offers.
</p>

<p>
A few remarks:
<ul>
<li> There are several websites
(like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/joinstudent">Amazon</a>) that
offer discounts to students. How they actually check that someone is a
student is not always clear. With IRMA this can now be done in an
easy, reliable and privacy-friendly manner.

<li> Via SURFconext email addresses are available too as IRMA
attributes. They are not used in this demo in order to avoid
identifying data.

<li> At this stage this attribute issuance is available only for
students and staff members of a limited number of institutions in
higher eduction in the Netherlands. Are you studying or working at
such an institution but does your institution not occur in the list at
the <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/surfnet?action=login">SURFconext
issuance page</a>? This means that your institution has not "switched
on" the connection to the foundation Privacy by Design. In that case
you cannot receive attributes via SURFconext. The best thing that you
can do is to contact locally at your institution the people
responsible for computer support (in particular: identity management)
and ask them to send an email to the
address <tt>support'at'surfconext.nl</tt>, with the simple request:
Please give the Privacy by Design foundation access as Service
Provider to our institution (in Dutch: <em>AUB de stichting Privacy by
Design voor onze instelling toelaten als Service Provider</em>).
</ul>
