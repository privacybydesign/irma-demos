        <h1>Demo: verification of e-mail address with IRMA</h1>

        <div id="result_status"></div>

        <p>
        This page contains an example of a simple e-mail check with IRMA.  At
        the same time some explanation is given about how this works and how
        this can be used, especially by organisations with their own e-mail
        addresses: they can let users log in with these addresses. In this
        manner a separate password to log in is no longer needed.
        </p>

        <p>
        The left button below checks if the disclosed e-mail address is
        a <tt>gmail.com</tt> address. Only in that case the verification
        succeeds. The same mechanism can be used to provide exclusive access
        for visitors with e-mail addresses from other organisations.
        </p>

        <p>
        The button on the right asks for any e-mail address and displays
        it on the subsequent page. This can be used for visitors who
        are asked to register with an e-mail address.
        </p>

        <p>
        In order to be able to try out yourself the buttons below one needs to
        have the IRMA
        app <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/download-en/">installed</a>.
        After registration it typically contains at least one e-mail address.
        Additional e-mail addresses can be added via
        the <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/email">e-mail
        issuance webpage</a> of the Privacy by Design foundation.
        </p>

        <div class="text-center">
        <tr><td>
        <button style="margin: 1em" class="btn btn-primary" id="try_irma_gmailbtn">Check gmail address</button>
        </td>
        <td>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </td>
        <td>
        <button style="margin: 1em" class="btn btn-primary" id="try_irma_emailbtn">Reveal e-mail address</button>
        </td>
        </tr>
        </div>

        <p>
        A few remarks:
        <ul>
        <li> No information about e-mail addresses is retained or collected
        via this webpage. The revealed e-mail addresses are only used for the
        purpose of this demo and disappear at the moment that the demo is
        closed.

        <li> The verification whether the disclosed address is actually
        a gmail address is performed in javascript in the browser (client)
        of the user. This is not the way this should be done properly,
        but this is harmless in the current demo. The appropriate way
        is to perform this check at the server's side.
        </ul>
        </p>
