            This page shows <em>chained Yivi sessions</em>: multiple sequential Yivi sessions
            where the contents of later Yivi sessions may depend on the earlier sessions.
            In this demo you disclose your name in the first sesssion, which is then used without
            further user interaction in the second session. This second session issues the premium membership
            card which includes your name from the first session.
        </p>

            This demo is not a real video-streaming service but it does demonstrate several aspects of Yivi. 
            When you become YiviTube “premium member” using the “Become premium member” button, you receive a 
            membership card in your Yivi app with your name on it. Subsequently, you can use the data on this
            card to watch  <a href="https://yivitube.yivi.app">(trailers of) movies</a>
            on the YiviTube main page. As a premium member you also have access to the premium contents when clicking the "Show premium contents" button.
