<p>
This page contains an example of a simple age check with Yivi,
together with an explanation of how this works and can be used, for
instance by webshops or video sites. With the button below it can be
checked whether a visitor of such a site is indeed older than
18. What's special about Yivi is its privacy-friendliness: the visitor
reveals no other information than the fact that (s)he is 18+.
</p>

<p>
In order to be able to try out yourself the button below you need to
have the Yivi
app <a href="https://yivi.app/#download">installed</a>
with at least your <b>personal data</b> card loaded.  This can be done via
the Dutch <a href="https://yivi.nijmegen.nl/login">BRP
issuance webpage</a>.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
    <button class="custom-button" id="try_irma_18btn">Older than 18 check</button>
</div>

<p>
A few remarks:
<ul>
<li> A similar button can be used for other age checks, like "older
than 12", "older than 16", or even "older than 65". These personal
data can be collected by anyone in the Netherlands.  The software for
checking these attributes, as used here, is open source, freely
available, and can be used without costs, see also
the Yivi documentation <a href="https://docs.staging.yivi.app/">webpage</a> with more information on this.

<li> Buttons like the above one are especially relevant for webshops
that have a legal obligation to perform age verification when offering
violent or possibly offensive games or films, or by gambling
sites. The button could also be used to regulate online access to
catch up TV programs. Currently, many of these sites do not have
proper age checks because there is no user-friendly (and cheap)
technology available. With Yivi this excuse can no longer be used.

<li> With Yivi it is possible to perform not only "older than" but
also "younger than" checks, such as "younger than 16" or "younger than
12". Such checks can be used to restrict access to certain webpages or
chat sites to minors --- and to exclude others, in principle. So far,
these "younger than" data are not issued in Yivi, on the one side
because no specific application has emerged, and on the other side
because it is unclear from which age onwards one can reasonably expect
children to use the Yivi app.
