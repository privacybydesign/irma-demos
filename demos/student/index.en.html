<p>
This page contains an example of using Yivi for verifying whether
someone is a student or not. Additionally, the page explains how this
works and how this can be used for instance by webshops that wish to
give special offers to students. The first button below can be used to
check if a visitor actually is a student. The special point of Yivi is
its privacy-friendliness: the visitor discloses no other information
than the mere fact that (s)he is a student. 
</p>

<p>
Via the second button it is possible to request additional
information, namely the role of the visitor (student or employee) and
the name of the university (or educational institute) with which the
student/employee is associated. In this way exclusive access can be
organised for students and/or employees of a particular institute.
</p>


<p>
In order to be able to try out yourself the buttons below you need to
have the Yivi
app <a href="https://yivi.app/#download">installed</a>
with at least the card with educational data loaded into the app.
This can be done
via <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/surfnet?action=login">SURFconext
issuance webpage</a> of the Privacy by Design foundation. A succesful
check that the visitor is a student gives access to special offers.

A few remarks:
<ul>
<li> There are several websites
(like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/joinstudent">Amazon</a>) that
offer discounts to students. How they actually check that someone is a
student is not always clear. With Yivi this can now be done in an
easy, reliable and privacy-friendly manner.

<li> Via SURFconext email addresses are available too as personal data
in your Yivi app. They are not used in this demo in order to avoid
identifying data.

<li> At this stage this issuance of academic data is available only
for students and staff members of a limited number of institutions in
higher eduction in the Netherlands. Are you studying or working at
such an institution but does your institution not occur in the list at
the <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/surfconext/surfconext/">SURFconext
issuance page</a>? This means that your institution has not "switched
on" the connection to the foundation Privacy by Design. In that case
you cannot receive your personal data in your Yivi app via
SURFconext. The best thing that you can do is to contact locally at
your institution the people responsible for computer support (in
particular: identity management) and ask them to send an email to the
address <tt>support'at'surfconext.nl</tt>, with the simple request:
Please give the Privacy by Design foundation access as Service
Provider to our institution (in Dutch: <em>AUB de stichting Privacy by
Design voor onze instelling toelaten als Service Provider</em>).
</ul>
